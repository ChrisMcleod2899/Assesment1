    </i></p>
    <p class="w3-justify">I was born and raised on Norfolk Island, an external Australian Territory, located 1412km off
      the east coast of Australia, in the South Pacific with a population of only approximately 1600
      locals. I relocated to Brisbane after completing Year 12 to study a bachelor of Multimedia at
      Griffith University, as tertiary education is not accessible on island. There I learned the
      basics of programming languages such as HTML, Javascript and how to program Lego
      Mindstorms. I have also delved into design tools such as Illustrator, Photoshop and
      InDesign. I speak English and a local dialect called ‘Norf’k’ which is derived from both
      Tahitian and 18 th century English tongue.
    </p>
    <p class="w3-justify">My hobbies include, listening to podcasts, I read a
      lot of articles, join in discussion online and watch YouTube videos endlessly when I’m trying
      to understand a new topic or idea. This helps me have a better understanding of how things
      work and how technology can shape the future. I enjoy keeping up to date with current
      technology trends, especially before software and hardware enters the mainstream. I’ve
      always enjoyed fashion and more specifically the increasing intersection between fashion
      and technology. I see this as an emerging market with wearable devices etc. increasing
      becoming a part of every day life.</p>
      <p class="w3-justify">I’ve started to delve back into programming as I start this new course to refresh my
      memory, whether it’s an app teaching me ‘Python’ or ‘Swift’, the core of each language is
      similar just with different commands.</p>
<div id="INTEREST">
      <h2>INTEREST IN IT</h2>
      <p class="w3-justify">My Interest in information technology started at an early age. I remember being 8 years old
        when I saw the Apple iBook in Turquoise displayed at a local store. I didn’t know what it
        was, or what it did, but I knew I wanted to learn more. Growing up our family had our first
        computer which was connected to the internet via a dial-up connection. I would sit for
        hours after school going through the settings of the computer just to see how I could learn
        more about how it worked. The early days of the internet piqued more curiosity; I would try
        to accomplish a task such as downloading music onto an MP3 player which would come
        with issues. So, I would set out to problem solve until I could find a solution, learning so
        much along the way. Tinkering with computers is how I first learnt about how software and
        hardware work together which is so valuable when you’re growing up as it sets a great
        foundation for learning more when you’re older.</p>
        <p class="w3-justify">I chose to come to RMIT as I was at a crossroads in my life, I currently work for an online
          Pharmacy, helping in the dispensary to dispense medication and fulfill online orders. I enjoy
          my work, however I decided I want to study I.T to increase my employability, in a field I
          already have real life experience with and want to pursue further.
          I hope to diversify my understanding across all I.T concepts and emerging trends during this
          course, with more focus on the practical side aiming for a career somewhere in this variable
          industry. I would like to further understand the basics of programming, UX design, cloud
          computing and industry standards which will assist me further post-grad in finding a job I’m
          passionate about. I’m excited to learn it all!

              <p class="w3-justify">Digital Designer (Web &amp; Interaction Design)
                https://www.seek.com.au/job/58333698?type=standout#sol=033e8ff9c3a6c57d77fc8a06e074d9cedb796df7
                This position is for a Web &amp; Interaction designer for a fashion retailer called Culture Kings.
                This company has both brick-and-mortar stores but more importantly a large e-commerce
                store. The job advertised is for someone to implement their skillset in digital areas such as
                User Interface and User Experience design to ensure the customers experience is elevated
                resulting in higher sales for the company. Culture Kings requires the employee of this role to
                be proficient in Adobe CS programs such as Illustrator, Photoshop and InDesign as all these
                products can be used to create a more immersive website experience. You must also have a
                high level of understanding in both HTML and CSS as these are crucial to creating and
                designing websites. Most importantly I believe, that for this role you need to have a great
                amount of knowledge of UI and UX design. Building a cohesive website that is not only
                intuitive but sticks to the brand DNA whilst actively pushing for conversions is the main goal
                of this position. 3 years of experience in design (ideally in fashion or retail) is required for
                this role.</p>

                  applying for a job like this. My current job of 6 years has me heavily involved in working with
                  our online Pharmaceutical store. This has given me a lot of experience when it comes to the
                  day-to-day operations of running an online store. I work a lot in the back end of this website ensuring our customers experience is smooth. I find this experience will be valuable for
                  finding my future career.
                </p><p class="w3-justify">
                  To apply for this position, I would need to learn more about HTML and CSS as well as doing
                  short courses on the Adobe CS suite. This is to make sure I’m up to date with the latest
                  versions of these programs as they always change. Adobe offers a whole range of free
                  training and tutorials for their creative suite. I would need to find work experience in the
                  fashion or retail industry as I would need to learn more about this industry and customers’
                  expectations of design elements when using an online store for shopping.

                        <p style="text-align:center;"><img src="VISUAL1.png" alt="Logo"></p>
                        <p class="w3-justify">Kellogg School of Management Creativity Test. This test is summarised as a ‘test that helps you determine if you have the personality traits,
                          attitudes, values, motivations, and interests that characterize creativity. It is based on several years&#39; study of attributes possessed by men and women in a variety of fields and
                          occupations who think and act creatively.’ #4
                        </p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="KELLOGG.png" alt="Logo"></p>
<p class="w3-justify">After reading the results and scores of these tests a number of key personality and artistic
traits have become clear. One being that I’m quite straight down the middle with a lot of
aspects of my personality. I’m neither too outspoken/extroverted or to quiet/introverted. I
am ‘driven by curiosity’ #5 which I do believe to be very true, although this doesn’t always
translate to productivity as my personality trait can lend itself to being impatient and
dissatisfied. As a Visual ISFP Learner I retain information when learning in real world
situations. And If there’s an emotional connection I am more likely to engage with an idea or
topic. I learn well when in groups and through brainstorming and when study materials are
readily available. I have an above average creativity score.
</p>
<p class="w3-justify">The results of these tests reinforces ideas I already had about my strengths when working in
a group. I find working in groups engaging as I have a personality that makes people feel
welcome and I enjoy brainstorming and working together. But when needed I can resign to
my own project to do solo work without feeling as though I need a group to assist me to
complete delegated tasks. I would also make sure when working in a team that I ask for
help when I need it as my learning style could be quite different to others. I don’t think this
would hinder the ability for teamwork but I would need to make sure my team is aware
I may require additional clarification. This would be through ways that I understand (such as
visual learning, or through the Visual-ISFP framework) as shown in my test results.
</p>
<p class="w3-justify">
  When forming teams I gravitate towards a group that already had a clear leader as I
  would work well under someone who directs where the team needs to go. Not to say I’m a
  sheep, as I definitely make my voice heard when needed. But if I can focus on my own work
  and not have to rally a team together, I feel I would be more efficient
</p></div>
<div id="PROJECT">
      <h2>PROJECT</h2>
      <p class="w3-justify">My idea is to create a network where health professionals and pharmacists can quickly and
efficiently communicate with each other for patient based specialised services and queries.
It would focus predominantly on creating a direct line of communication between doctors
(in both hospitals and private practices) and pharmacists (in both public and community
settings). It would be available on desktop via a cloud service and as a mobile application.
Both versions would be powered by cloud computing software. The program would also
ideally be integrated with existing industry standard software used in the health space.

This project has come about from personal experience working in the healthcare space.
Communication between pharmacists and doctors is practiced already in the industry as it’s
such an important part of providing quality care to patients, but the methods used are time
consuming and dated. Usually communication is via fax, phone or email, with additional
barriers at each step. I believe a new state-wide system needs to be implemented to vastly
improve the time taken out of healthcare workers days trying to communicate sometimes
complex problems with one another before coming to a solution. ‘Approximately 6% of
hospital admissions are associated with adverse drug events and high error rates during
transfer of care. Poor communication was the most important common factor contributing
to medication errors. Increased interprofessional collaboration between doctors and
pharmacists could therefore reduce the considerable medication-related morbidity and
mortality.’ #6 Put simply, the benefit of this system would be to securely have a direct line
of communication between doctors, pharmacists and other healthcare professionals to
avoid any errors. Common mistakes on prescriptions and issues with transferring of care can
take up to 24 hours to resolve using today’s industry standard of communication between
professionals.</p>
        <p class="w3-justify">The idea for this program is to build an end-to-end encrypted messaging and information
service which includes text, images and audio/video conferencing. Once enrolled, the
following healthcare professionals listed will have a direct line with each other: Pharmacists,
Doctors practising at Hospitals/Clinics/Private Practices and select administration staff. This
program is beneficial to patients as it takes out the time-consuming task of healthcare
professionals trying to communicate through normal means of email,
call and fax. Example: Pharmacist is presented with a script from a patient who has just
been discharged from a hospital. The pharmacist notices an error in the script which could
cause a potentially fatal drug interaction with the patient’s current medication. They need
to contact the doctor to discuss and amend. Current industry practice is to either email,
waiting 24-48 hours for a reply, or call the hospital, and be passed from department to
department, put on hold, or wait for doctor to call back if they even receive the message
from the receptionist. This happens too often and takes too long. Using this system, the
pharmacist can search for the doctor, contact them directly and have the discussion cutting
out the middlemen and waiting. The functionality of this app means the doctor can even
write a new script, take a photo and send through to pharmacist for dispensing. In reverse,
a doctor or GP might need to discuss or simply request a patients current medication list
with the patient’s pharmacist but doesn’t have time to call. As the service is encrypted and
only used by registered medical professionals, they can transfer med charts using the
messaging feature so they’re not sending confidential information via email or fax. Private
patient information is only being seen by the medical professionals and no other staff.
        </p>
<p class="w3-justify">
  The goal of this program is to create clear and confidential lines of communication between
  pharmacists, doctors and other medical professionals. We would try to keep the foundation
  of this program and app as basic as possible in the beginning to avoid any complications that
  can come with designing a complex app. We would build this application on Amazon Web
  Services using Python coding language due to its versatility. AWS is a perfect cloud platform
  which can handle a steady or quick increase in traffic. Usually when professionals are
  required by law to sign up to certain services as a requirement of their license large influxes
  can occur close to its due date. We would also use React Native to create a cross-platform
  mobile app that works with the website. This is beneficial so we don’t have to use the Swift
  language for Apple products specifically which would take more time.</p>
<p class="w3-justify">If we were successful in building and deploying this service with the help of the State
Government, I believe the NSW State Healthcare Industry would set a new standard for how
healthcare professionals provide critical care to patients in Australia. The doctors and
pharmacists would have a clear real time channel of communication with
each other resulting in better outcomes for patients and avoiding any errors that occur due
to a breakdown in lines of communication.</p>
